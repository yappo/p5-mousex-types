This is Perl module MouseX::Types.

INSTALLATION

MouseX::Types installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is set up,
you should just be able to do

    % cpan MouseX::Types

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

Note that manual installation requires the following modules before you can
run the above `perl Makefile.PL` command:

    * Module::Install
    * Module::Install::AuthorTests
    * Module::Install::Repository


You will then need to install other prerequisites listed by `perl Makefile.PL`
to complete the build.

DOCUMENTATION

MouseX::Types documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc MouseX::Types

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
